## PURPOSE

The goal is to deploy on [Flask] a [Deep Learning] model as a microservice. The model is used to predict handwritten digits and it has been previously trained on a [Jupyter Notebook]. [REST API] are utilized to communicate with the deployed model. e.g. send image to be analized and return the generated predictions to the client. [GitHub Actions] are employed to implement CI/CD workflows in the project.

## DEPENDENCIES

The code has been tested using:

- [Python] (3.12): an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming.
- [Jupyter Lab] (4.3): a web-based interactive development environment for [Jupyter Notebooks], code and data.
- [Flask] (3.1): a microframework for [Python] based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions.
- [Gunicorn] (23.0): a [Python] [WSGI] HTTP Server for UNIX.
- [NGINX] (1.27): a free, open-source, high-performance HTTP server, reverse proxy, and IMAP/POP3 proxy server.
- [Docker] (27.3): an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications, whether on laptops, data center VMs, or the cloud.
- [Docker Compose] (2.29): a tool for defining and running multi-container [Docker] applications.
- [Keras] ([TensorFlow] built-in): a high-level neural networks [API], written in [Python] and capable of running on top of [TensorFlow].
- [TensorFlow] (2.18): an open source software [Deep Learning] library for high performance numerical computation using data flow graphs.
- [Matplotlib] (3.9): a plotting library for [Python] and its numerical mathematics extension [NumPy].
- [NumPy] (2.0): a library for [Python], adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
- [Ruff] (0.8): An extremely fast Python linter and code formatter, written in Rust.
- [scikit-image] (0.24): a collection of algorithms for image processing with [Python].

### PYTHON VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT

Virtual environment (<env_name>=**.venv**) can be generated from **requirements_dev.txt** file located in the repository.

Command to configure virtual environment with [venv]:

```bash
~/deeplearning_flask$ python3 -m venv .venv
~/deeplearning_flask$ source .venv/bin/activate
(.venv)~/deeplearning_flask$ python3 -m pip install pip==24.3.1
(.venv)~/deeplearning_flask$ python3 -m pip install setuptools==75.6.0
(.venv)~/deeplearning_flask$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
(.venv)~/deeplearning_flask$ pre-commit install
```

## ARCHITECTURE

The architecture created with [Docker Compose] uses two different [Docker] containers for:

- [NGINX].
- [Flask] and [Gunicorn].

The following diagram illustrates the architecture in blocks:

```mermaid

  Client<-->NGINX;
  NGINX<--brigde-->Gunicorn;
  subgraph web;
  Gunicorn<-->Flask;
  end;
```

## DEEP LEARNING MODEL

The definition and training of the [Deep Learning] MNIST model was done through a notebook in [Jupyter Lab]. The employed notebook is stored in the main folder, to run it use the command shown below:

```bash
(.venv)~/deeplearning_flask$ jupyter lab Deep\ Learning\ MNIST\ prediction\ model\ with\ Keras.ipynb
```

## HOW TO RUN DEEP LEARNING ON FLASK WITH DOCKER COMPOSE

The steps and commands to run the [Deep Learning] model on the [Flask] server with [Docker Compose] are described below.

Before executing [Docker Compose] is strongly recommended to close other applications to free up resources and ports to avoid potential issues. Then [Docker Compose] can be executed to build services.

```bash
~/deeplearning_flask$ docker compose build
```

Next step consists in executing [Docker Compose] up command.

```bash
~/deeplearning_flask$ docker compose up
```

If everything goes fine at the end it should appear something similar to:

```bash
...
...
web_1    | 2020-06-04 19:30:17.818273: I tensorflow/compiler/xla/service/service.cc:176]   StreamExecutor device (0): Host, Default Version
```

## TEST SERVER & REST API

There are different ways to check that the server is running properly. One is opening a web browser such as Chrome or Firefox and paste the following URL:

```bash
http://127.0.0.1/
```

The web browser should show the text "Deep Learning on Flask".

[REST API] can be tested with [pytest] or [curl].

It is possible to execute tests of [Flask] microservice created with [pytest] from inside the [Flask] [Docker] container using [Makefile]:

```bash
~/deeplearning_flask$ docker exec -it deeplearning_flask-web-1 /bin/bash
~/app# make test
...
============================= test session starts ==============================
platform linux -- Python 3.12.7, pytest-8.3.3, pluggy-1.5.0
rootdir: /app/tests
collected 2 items

test_app.py ..                                                           [100%]
```

Those tests are also automatically executed with CI/CD workflows implemented with [GitHub Actions] for every push and pull request in the project repository.

A POST example using [curl] from outside [Docker] container is shown below:

```bash
~/deeplearning_flask$ curl -F file=@app/app/static/4.jpg -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1/api/predictlabel' | json_pp

      },
      {
         "label" : "6",
         "probability" : "2.4940262e-05"
      },
      {
         "label" : "7",

         "probability" : "5.569217e-05"
      }
   ],
   "success" : true
}
```
